# Book Shop Simple Operation Interaction with multi interfaces 

## on summary (on java) : 
### the operation inside the applciation done with this strucuture 
#### two types one is user and admin (staff,managers) (same conditions)
# user operations (after sgining up/in or forgot password):

> note that there can be just 2 persons who can sgin inside one day in my arctuure of the applcaition to make the usage of the google firebase be more efficent on the usage of the anothor operation and check on the splash screen interface to check the connection with google.com on https type request get to connection check becuase this bookshop application must have a security on the inside interface on the application to avoid any misconnection to let the user login and sgin up with privite domain of the private unviersity of the oic , to avoid any data misleaded or misminoshed strucutre in the security field and there is easy to interaction of the data password structure 

#### 1- main page ( include 2,3)
##### 1- notifacation page 
##### 2- search page (with mini interface gate as editbox and book mini-interface also as photo)
##### 3- user information page

##### 4- searching with string.contine(string) if occurs that with department or id or name then it shows up 
> the search page is implicitly called with each interface to increase the cpu time on usage depending on less time app usage
##### 5- product on also implicait calling on the search view  , (the product view : loading photos with json links on searching view implicitly calling with index searching with differant link on the view  for the related book branch (i can also to assgin the depatment of the book and make it on the same view of the listview of the search view after the sorting if he did sorting , at that moment i can insure what he thinking about as variable and stored to show him the product each time ,cart creating the map and set it to the db interface , buy btons approcah with after cretation and insert the map to the list map ) ,open the address pdf in my own page desgined with inter-domain-requests webview in java , also there is on faviourite and wishlist locally stored and on the db stored but on the session storing the db and loading it we don't wont to store to the db until he end the session by the main class )


#### 4- user information page
##### 1- myprofile page (contines password-hidden text (one click-reset enabled) , email , balance , histoy of the operation with local stored on shrehed preferacne and on the end stored in the db as the all and also all of them are laoded at the first logging in time (this is floating btn ))

# admin operations (after sgining up/in or forgot password):

> note in my system desgin the system provide one email means one person can and only inside the system login in , and the approch of the implemntion of the code is simple on the integrantion of the interfaces to code it
> by ai tools can gernate the same syntax of the code the strucure is depending in the secutity and complexity of the algorithms over the time simulation purpose


#### the code is desgined with perfectizm of teh ai-tools approcah over the time of the usage of the ai and created on the quality time approcah 
##### as i am ai-enginer i cna insure the efficent working approchs in all of the inside that code not that gernal code on the just sturucure 
##### the geranliztion is not in my systems desgined !!
##### you can check the size of the java applciation size !!
