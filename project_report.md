# Project Report

## Introduction
The project is an online admin gateway that implements a security mechanism requiring a PIN for access. This system is designed to ensure that only authorized personnel can manage user data and interfaces.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- The system requires a PIN for access, ensuring that only one admin can access the system at a time.
- Management features allow the admin to oversee user data and application interfaces.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should respond quickly to user requests.
- **Security**: Strong measures must be in place to prevent unauthorized access, particularly concerning database security.
- **Usability**: The interface should be user-friendly for the admin.

## Design Prototype
The architecture of the admin gateway includes a centralized database (Firebase) and a user interface that allows the admin to manage user data securely.

## Source Code
The main components of the project include:
- HTML files for the user interface.
- CSS files for styling.
- JavaScript files for functionality and interaction with the database.

## Build Packages
The project utilizes Firebase for database management and may include other build tools as necessary.

## Evaluations
### Test Cases
Potential test cases include:
- Validating the PIN entry process.
- Ensuring that only one admin can access the system at a time.

### Test Executions
Tests can be executed through manual testing of the user interface and automated tests for backend functionality.

### Analysis
Results from the tests will be analyzed to identify any security vulnerabilities or performance issues.

## Conclusion
The admin gateway project aims to provide a secure and efficient management system for user data. Future improvements may include the implementation of a distributed database architecture.
