# University Bookshop Android App

## Project Overview
This project, developed by the **PALESTINE Supporter Team**, aims to create a user-friendly **Android App** for a university bookshop. The current bookshop lacks an efficient digital platform, leading to accessibility and user-experience challenges. The app will improve access, browsing, and purchasing options for students and staff, with features such as a catalog, search functionality, and a secure payment gateway.

## Key Features
- **24/7 Accessibility**: Students can access the bookshop and browse for books anytime.
- **Convenient Browsing and Purchasing**: Easy to navigate catalog and user-friendly purchase options.
- **Promotions and New Arrivals**: Notification system for book promotions, discounts, and new stock arrivals.
- **Secure Payments**: Integration with a secure payment gateway.

- **Abdulmajeed** - Frontend Developer, App Integration

## Goals
The app addresses several challenges faced by students:
